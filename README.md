# Implementation and Simulation of Stochastic Models in Finance using Python

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and simulation of stochastic models used in quantitative finance, specifically the Black-Scholes, Heston, Dupire, and SABR models. The goal is to simulate asset price trajectories, calibrate these models using real market data, and compare their performance. Additionally, the project involves designing and implementing trading algorithms based on quantitative strategies and evaluating their performance in various market conditions.
